## Refactoring cycles

### Cycle 1 — Baseline evidence and OpenAPI generation

#### Scope

- Original files: repository configuration and GraphQL metadata only; no domain extraction
- New files: active call graph, baseline, decomposition plan, test matrix/data contract, Swagger contract documentation, database usage/optimization documentation, OpenAPI generator/comparator
- Endpoints: all active REST endpoints represented by generated OpenAPI
- UI workflow: itinerary details route and existing Playwright coverage inventoried
- Tables: static Prisma model/index inventory only

#### Baseline

- High-risk files measured from the current tree; see `service-decomposition-plan.md`
- Query counts/timings: not claimed; safe fixture not yet measured
- Swagger paths: 499; operations: 603
- Existing tests: frontend 9/9 pass; backend 13/14 pass

#### Change

- Added repeatable OpenAPI generation and contract comparison scripts.
- Added explicit nullable GraphQL `String` metadata for `DashboardDailyMomentV2Type` and `DashboardStarPerformerV2Type`, allowing Swagger bootstrap to complete without changing runtime values.
- No service extraction, query optimization, index mutation, route change or database write.

#### Verification

- Backend build: PASS
- Prisma validation: PASS
- OpenAPI generation: PASS
- OpenAPI self-comparison: route parity PASS; duplicate IDs/schema refs FAIL as existing findings
- Frontend unit tests/build: PASS
- Frontend lint: pre-existing failure
- Playwright/API/integration: pending safe fixture

#### Result

- Baseline retained and committed.
- Remaining risks: existing route optimizer test failure, Swagger metadata defects, broad lint debt, missing isolated integration fixture.

### Cycle 2 — Route optimizer normalization wiring

#### Scope

- Original file: `src/modules/itineraries/itineraries.service.ts`
- Responsibility: route-chain normalization, duplicate-stop removal and terminal-anchor protection
- Endpoint/UI workflow: itinerary save with route optimization; no controller or frontend route changed
- Tables: none directly; distance lookup remains behind the existing service method

#### Baseline

- Original file size: 37,413 lines
- Existing focused result: 13 passed / 1 failed
- Failure: `route-optimizer-normalization.test.ts` expected duplicate/terminal normalization that `optimizeRouteOrder()` did not invoke
- Query count/timing: not measured; test uses a stubbed distance method

#### Change

- Routed `optimizeRouteOrder()` through its existing `extractRouteOptimizationContext()` helpers.
- Preserved broken route chains and terminal-anchor-only artifacts in original order.
- Removed the PHP-parity length guard for normalized output so duplicate movable stops can be removed safely.
- No API route, DTO, response contract, transaction, query, index or frontend change.

#### Verification

- Route optimizer test: PASS
- Focused backend suite: 14/14 PASS
- Backend build: PASS
- OpenAPI route/contract parity: PASS against baseline
- OpenAPI quality checks: existing 14 duplicate operation IDs and 2 broken schema references remain

#### Result

- Behaviour characterization now passes for route normalization, duplicate stops, terminal anchors and broken chains.
- Retained and ready for the next small extraction only after the Swagger findings are either fixed or explicitly bounded.

### Cycle 3 — Swagger/OpenAPI contract repair

#### Scope

- Original files: `src/main.ts`, `src/modules/locations/locations.controller.ts`, GraphQL/dashboard metadata
- New file: `src/common/swagger/normalize-openapi.ts`
- Endpoint/UI workflow: all REST documentation; no route handler or frontend API call changed
- Tables: none

#### Baseline

- OpenAPI generation: 499 paths / 603 operations
- Existing findings: 14 duplicate operation IDs from the dual-prefix STAAH controller and 2 unregistered location response DTO references
- Contract drift: 0 when comparing route/method/request/response contracts

#### Change

- Registered `ViaRouteResponseDto` and `SuggestedRouteResponseDto` with the Locations controller.
- Added deterministic unique operation IDs for duplicate alias operations while preserving the first public operation ID and all HTTP routes.
- Applied the same normalization to runtime Swagger setup and the baseline generator.

#### Verification

- Backend build: PASS
- OpenAPI generation: PASS; configured MySQL connection initialized
- OpenAPI comparison: PASS — 603 routes, no missing/added/changed contracts, no duplicate IDs, no broken refs
- Prisma validation: PASS
- Backend focused tests: PASS, 14/14

#### Result

- Contract tier retained and committed.
- Remaining risk: runtime route-precedence coverage still needs an isolated API test; no route definitions were changed in this cycle.

### Cycle 4 — Extract itinerary route normalization policy

#### Scope

- Original file: `src/modules/itineraries/itineraries.service.ts`
- Extracted responsibility: pure route-chain normalization, terminal-anchor recognition, broken-chain detection and movable-stop deduplication
- New files: `src/modules/itineraries/services/itinerary-route-normalization.service.ts`, `test/itinerary-route-normalization.test.ts`
- Endpoint/UI workflow: itinerary save route optimization; existing controller/API shape unchanged
- Tables: none

#### Baseline

- Original file size: 37,413 lines; static DB-call matches: 607
- Route normalization characterization: embedded in optimizer test; 14/14 focused backend tests passed before extraction
- Query count, DB duration and endpoint duration: not applicable to pure policy; distance method remains stubbed in tests
- Swagger operations: 603

#### Change

- Moved normalization policy methods behind `ItineraryRouteNormalizationService`.
- Kept `ItinerariesService` as the public compatibility facade and injected the new provider through `ItinerariesModule`.
- Added direct unit coverage for duplicate movable stops, broken chains and terminal anchors.
- No query, transaction, DTO, route, response, index or frontend change.

#### Verification

- Normalizer unit tests: PASS, 3/3
- Combined focused backend suite: PASS, 17/17
- Backend build: PASS
- Prisma validation: not rerun after pure extraction; prior checkpoint PASS
- OpenAPI comparison: not rerun after pure extraction; no controller metadata changed
- Frontend tests/build: prior checkpoint PASS
- Playwright: preflight and audit PASS; workflow execution pending configured fixture

#### Result

- Extraction retained.
- Original facade is smaller and route policy now has a narrow public interface.
- Remaining risk: constructor still coordinates many unrelated services; future extractions must preserve transaction boundaries and provider behavior.
